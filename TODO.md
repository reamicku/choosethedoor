## TODO

Implement **Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT)**

### Crossover algorithms

[Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover_(genetic_algorithm))

Implement the ability to share different neuron and connection configurations.

- One point crossover
- Multi point crossover
- Uniform crossover

### Mutations

- Create link
- Enable/disable link
- Shift weight/bias
- Completely random weight/bias
- Create a new neuron in the middle of a connection
  - preserve its function by setting connection weight to 1, and bias to 0
